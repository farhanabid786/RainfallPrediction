# ðŸŒ§ Rainfall Prediction App

A machine learning web app that predicts whether **rainfall will occur or not** based on current weather conditions. Built using a **Random Forest Classifier** and deployed with **Streamlit**.


## ðŸš€ Features

- Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- Real-time prediction of rainfall (Yes/No)
- Uses key weather inputs: pressure, dewpoint, humidity, windspeed, etc.
- Cleaned and preprocessed weather dataset
- Easily extendable to support advanced models (e.g., XGBoost)
